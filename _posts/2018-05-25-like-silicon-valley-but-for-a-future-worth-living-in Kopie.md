### - a pitch for our ideals.
<br>
<br>
*We don’t have to worry that the cosmos will be changed by out theories about the cosmos. The Planets
really don’t care what we think or how we theorize about them. But we do have to worry that human nature
will be changed by our theory of human nature." (..) "We 'design' human nature, by designing the 
institutions within people live. So we must ask ourselves just what kind of human nature we want to help 
design."* <br>-Barry Schwartz <br>

<br>
<br>
After they died in the political sphere, silicon valley now also holds the monopoly on visions for our future. <br>
It’s creating the systems and institutions that all of us are going to live in. Systems we’ll live in and therefore systems that’ll shape us, that shape our society.<br>
<br>
Now it’s not the democratic system, the people, who design their own future, but Silicon Valley, which designs the future for us.<br>
And it is not only undemocratic, but it also manages the paradox of being free of any values and fundamentalistic at the same time. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
First of all, Silicon Valley comprehends people with the same logic it comprehends machines: There is an input that leads to an output. <br>
The only values are numbers and letters. Values to be manipulated by them. <br>
Pure logic, deprived of anything personal or interpersonal, and of the entire notion of free will and free decision making. Cybernetics at the core. Deprived of anything that makes us human, deprived of values.<br>
And a society that adapts to this system, consequently, becomes the very same thing. A society free from values. A society without a compass. <br>
<br>
And although this image of humanity may not be prefered by everybody, it still is legitimate to have it, and not only legitimate, but it is necessary that some people have it. <br>
Every new perspective opens new doors for us to see our problems through and can help us solve them in new ways.<br>
<br>
But if that one view is forced upon everybody, creepingly, through the system we live in, it can become dangerous.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that is precisely what’s happening. Politicians don’t have any visions for our future. <br>
The democratic system lays in its own ashes and there is no one, at the moment, who sparks a fire and fans the flames to fuel visions of a future under the terms and values of all people. <br>
<br>
Consequently, within this new vacuum, just a small group can have unregulated power over our societies outcome. An this small group, Silicon Valley, does not only live in its own filter bubble, it created them, draining the world of the understanding and exchange of ideas a democracy needs.<br>
<br>
At the same time, it is establishing itself, hidden behind shifting baselines, behind likes and behind endless newsfeeds. Behind the comfort that keeps us tolerating it.<br>
It lulles people to the point they lose their ability to decide for themself. To be of free will.<br>
And above all, to take a stand against this system which is enforced upon them by the very same people that caused this inability.<br>
<br>
It is draining society of the single most important requisite of a democracy. <br>
And not only that. They can in the same manner present themselves as the only option.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fundamentalists by definition have a fundament that usually consists if values or at least traditions.<br>
But since silicon valley does not even have that, instead, it is subscribing to one thing only.
And that is unconditional progress. <br>
Which is, effectively, the exact opposite of a value. Because it is unconditional it is without regard of anything else. It is: “move fast and break things”. It is in an invincible state.<br>
Silicon Valley cuts itself loose from the responsibilities of the present and from the barriers the past taught us to respect. They cut themself loose from any fundament. <br>
An invincible state that allows the monopolization of the entire idea of progress itself.<br>
It cannot be judged, thus it cannot be right or wrong. Progress is a given.<br> It is without alternative.<br>
If you judge it you try to inhibit human natural progress.<br>
And like everything else, progress too, becomes fundamentalistic the moment it cannot be questioned. When it’s without alternative.<br>
<br>
But there is one. There is an alternative.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The alternative to progress without values is progress with values. Lead by values.<br>
Values we can only draw in hindsight of all the things we learnt from our past and strive for in the present.<br>
We dont stay there. In the past. We don’t stay in the present. In fact, we most definitely shouldn’t stay there because if we believe in progress and technology, if we believe in people and society, we know that the future to come will be a better one, will be an improvement from what there is today, will be based on values, on freedom, on peace, on democracy, and individual rights.<br>
And that is exactly what distinguishes us from the people who try to build a future for us.<br>
<br>
So be bold, be new, be daring, be visionary again. But at the same time remember. <br>
Remember the past. Remember the frailties we learnt from, the dead ends we found, and the new ways we explored. <br>
And remember the present, remember that we don’t live free from accountability, free from judgement, and free from values we subscribe to living in a society together. <br>
Let’s remember all of that. Remember it because it is our compass for the only future that we should want to design, the only future that can be. And that’s a future worth living in for all of us and by all of us.
